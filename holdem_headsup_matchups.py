find a way to get an exhaustive list of all 52*51*50*49 omaha preflop hands
for each, calculate it's average winning percent on showdown against 1 random hand (take note of runtime and see what it takes to run against 2, 3 random)
after doing so, store each result and it's corresponding win %
for each hand, bring all possible flops; when the flop comes store the flop % and notice the change in equity from the long term 
did the flop make the hand value go up, down, or stay neutral?
is there a way to cluster the flops by +1%; +5%; +10% - i have am interested to see the distribution of flop textures against their long term associated equity
do the same on the turn; same on the river
do the same against the top 20% of hands; top 10% of hands; top 5% of hands

some technical thoughts:
- if i am having calculation issues ill have to set up the following system
- queue of all omaha hands that i want calculated
- that can be input to the emulator
- each instance that will run the emulator will need it's software installed first (that could be the hard part since this program depends on a C library...)


other future features:
- see your hand or opponents hand at showdown
- mobile app that indicates your opponent is playing x% of hands based on this hand strength
- let's say there are 5 hands you've seen him play - 1010J6 then he would play 99J7

- you can plug in your hand and see how favorable a flop that is for you in the long run
